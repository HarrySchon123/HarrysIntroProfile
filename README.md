Australian of German decent. Grandparents migrated due to tension as WW2 broke out. 

I love going to the AFL, I am a MCC member and have gone to the grand final 5 times.

### Interest in IT

I was always interested in computers and their hardware as there are so many components that all work together to make a computer work. I delved further into this as I made my own gaming computing to play games such as Total War and Civilization V. My IT experience is quite limited, I assisted the IT lead at my Dad’s engineering firm when I was 13 and have disassembled and cleaned dust and other particles out of the computers. 


I chose to come to RMIT because, in my opinion, it has the best location out of any university in Melbourne. As well as my cousin that transferred from Monash to RMIT that she has never looked back.


Going into and throughout my IT course I expect to learn the foundation and fundamentals of the IT industry that will give me a platform to get a job and continue my learning in a related field.
