Australian of German decent. Grandparents migrated due to tension as WW2 broke out. 

I love going to the AFL, I am a MCC member and have gone to the grand final 5 times.

### Interest in IT

I was always interested in computers and their hardware as there are so many components that all work together to make a computer work. I delved further into this as I made my own gaming computing to play games such as Total War and Civilization V. My IT experience is quite limited, I assisted the IT lead at my Dad’s engineering firm when I was 13 and have disassembled and cleaned dust and other particles out of the computers. 


I chose to come to RMIT because, in my opinion, it has the best location out of any university in Melbourne. As well as my cousin that transferred from Monash to RMIT that she has never looked back.


Going into and throughout my IT course I expect to learn the foundation and fundamentals of the IT industry that will give me a platform to get a job and continue my learning in a related field. 



### Ideal Job

The job advertisememnt: http://grads.woolworths.com.au/page/graduate-roles/


This position interests me as I have worked at Woolworths for nearly 3 years in the deli department and love the social environment of the work. As such, I would love to continue to work at Woolworths in their graduate IT department and learn new skills that would contribute to a flourishing career.  


As this is a graduate position limited knowledge is presumed as a tertiary education provides the basics whilst you learn most of the skills on the job. The skills I currently possess are from jobs that I have held from the age of 14 to now (18 years old). These include being able to file and scan documents, being able to assemble and rotate stock whilst working in a high pressured environment such as McDonalds and working cooperatively in a team environment and abiding by occupational health and safety and food safety to ensure a safe working environment for customers and staff.


I will build upon my skills of customer service and working in a team and apply those to an information technology environment to learn new skills.

*What do these tests mean for me?* 

I feel that because the result of the test was ‘protagonist’ is a good indicator that the potential of a leadership role in IT further down in my career when I have gathered more experience.  As a result of the online learning test I would convey my messages and ideas in this type of role visually to demonstrate a deeper understanding of the work. 


*How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?

The results from the Myer Briggs test say that I am extraverted. In a group environment I would be able to freely contribute ideas and speak openly about my concerns. Moreover, I may want to convey my ideas through visual means as well as verbally, as indicated in the learning style test. Furthermore, I may have difficulty working for a long sustained period of time and may need small breaks after long group sessions with my team. 


*How should you take this into account when forming a team? 

From the information gathered from the three tests taken I should look for people with similar social skills and learning patterns. Being in a group with people that are able to communicate and not feel anxious would increase workflow as not one member or members would come across as domineering to the quitter members. Furthermore, I would have to be in a group in which members are willing to be able to break up group meetings to create a better workflow with members who don’t have the attention span for long periods of time.
